                hi! my coder alias is <a href="https://github.com/cttps">cttps</a> and im a cs student that likes to code üòÅ. 
                i've been coding since very young and tbh it has taken me a while to figure out if i really do love coding,
                but building projects, solving problems, and learning seemingly impossible things is what i really enjoy and i think that's what  matters.
            </p>
            <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold">programming life</h1>
            <p>
                i've basically grown up always with programming in some way or another i guess. a lot of memories
                from my earliest friends are thinking about how to make games we thought of. i think i really first started
                to learn how to code when i was 6, when i picked up python. not long after that i was told to use java
                and i think that killed a lot of my desire to make the games that I wanted because it was too hard for me
                to understand at my age (though not for some of my old friends lol). i didn't exactly code much until 6th grade
                after that, i think the only other major milestone was learning to type a little faster and minecraft command blocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                after that, it was mostly coding in batch/shell scripts, making unity games from tutorials, and making some dumb programs in visual basic along with
                some scratch code from school. I think when i was bored and actually ended up making some stuff in php too for some reason.
                at some point though, i discovered roblox (for a second time actually), and started
                to learn about how to code games. it was really hard at first, and it took me a long, long time to understand
                client-server communication. But once I did, i was really obsessed with coding. i also really liked working
                with vfx sometime at the end of my roblox journey, but i think i've always wanted to just code what was in my head
                at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                during this roblox phase, i tinkered with a lot of different programming languages. C, C# (via unity), C++, Java (which we
                also learned in school, twice, and in uni again), javscript, and probably some more that i'm forgetting.
                anyway, at some point in late high-school i discovered Go, and it was very similar to Lua (and js which i sort of liked at the time).
                it was really easy to pick up, and i liked it a lot so I decided to try making stuff with it. honestly, i knew
                nothing about the web at all, and just by randomly calling functions and searching on stack overflow, i made a website!
                i think before that point, i did use express/MERN to make something, but i literally followed a tutorial for that and dont remember anything about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                i did a lot with go tbh. I had a phase where i was learning game hacking (because at the time there was the whole thing
                about riot vanguard and I wanted to know people were getting around the 'kernel level anticheat'). I used go to call C functions
                i think, and made a few programs to modify the assembly code in some old games I had on steam. i learned a bit of x86 through that actually,
                and it's been probably one of the more useful things i guess? i already understood pointers but coding some things in assembly gave me an understanding
                of registers that was different from like the basic MAR/MDR that we had learned in class. this phase died out tho unfortunately, but i had another
                hackery phase about privacy where i made my own encryption system for them in go. i've stuck with go since, and i love it a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                in uni, a lot of the content (esp in the first year) was stuff i already knew. I didn't really try hard at all and got decent grades throughout it i guess.
                uni, until recently, had been a journey for my personal development mostly. i barely coded, and with chatgpt rolling out after covid, there
                wasn't really anything i had to do to stay ontop of course work. at this point, its been maybe 4 years since i've been journaling, and its purpose has always been
                to help me figure out what I want to do with my life. i read up on random articles about this stuff a lot and never had a satisfying answer. but i think
                that i probably wont ever find out, and i've grown ok with that. i've started to code more often now, and it's been really fun. i really had to push myself to learn
                things i didnt understand, but when i did, i realized i could actually do it. this has been a mentality that i've kept and i know that i can learn hard things
                now. I even try to go out of my way to learn things i dont understand, because it's what other people arent willing to do. it's been fun!
            </p>
            <p>
                now, well i guess for a while, whats bugging me the most is AI. not really the advent of agi/asi, but where it stands now and in the near future.
                i finally rekindled my love for code that i lost 2 years ago, but current llms can basically code whatever project i can think up. i've made projects
                like that, and it isn't as fun as me coding myself. i'm not learning much, and it's faster not to. If i have an error, i can just dump the logs and code
                into a free llm and add their suggested fix. this is the point it's at now. i have genuine fear that software development, wont be coding anymore.
                the coding part is what's fun to me. unless im at the very front of the pack, building something that ai isn't taught, i dont think i'll be able to even
                find work without having to code using ai, and if that happens, i wont be able to enjoy this thing that i've been passionate about my whole life.
                well, if we get asi sooner, or agi thats able to learn new things, then my idea is that everyone would be redundant. i want to make a post about this later,
                but for now, the consequence is probably that everyone will just have to work a job that ai cant do, until ai can do it better.
            </p>
            <p>
                this obviously means that very few people might actually enjoy their job.
                so, my obvious conclusion is that i should work on getting asi here asap. theres also the fact current llms cant do novel research indepedently, so i'll even be able to
                problem solve, write novel code, etc. it sounds like a great idea, but the people at the front of ai research are so smart that it seems impossible to be up there
                with them. another solution is to work on something we are further behind on, like the robotics for machines that will embody ai.
                i'm sure they're also very intelligent people too, but im assuming there's going to be work that needs to be done on the software side of things
                that stays novel and unique. that assumption may not be true tho, and learning an entirely new part when ive dedicated myself to coding things much closer to the former
                is something that's going to be pretty hard. for now, i'm focusing on learning ML and ai, with the idea of starting some side projects involving robotics soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                so far, writing ml code has been done with llms. i'm taking the wrong approach because of that, but for now i just want to dip my toes into a field that i actually
                was initially (like 3-4 years ago) against working in. I know im far behind right now, and it seems impossible to get up there with the researchers who are
                probably some of the smartest on earth THIS late, but i don't really see any other choice for me so that's what im going to aim for, for now.

                thanks for reading all this! if you did read through everything, please feel free to contact me. i'd love to talk about anything tech related, and maybe
                i can get new insights.
