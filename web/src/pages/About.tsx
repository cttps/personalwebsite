                hi! my coder alias is <a href="https://github.com/cttps">cttps</a> and im a cs student that likes to code 😁. 
                i've been coding since very young and tbh it has taken me a while to figure out if i really do love coding,
                but building projects, solving problems, and learning seemingly impossible things is what i really enjoy and i think that's what  matters.
            </p>
        </div>
